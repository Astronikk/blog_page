    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I’m Nikhil Nagar, a product designer & associate focused on AI-driven finance tools at Finrep.</p>
    <p>This site is my digital garden: notes on product strategy, UX, and systems thinking as I learn.</p>
    <p>Outside work, you’ll find me exploring typography, running quick design sprints, or tinkering with no-code hacks.</p>
